# ecosystemProject
This project was implemented in my spare time to try a simulation of an ecosystem and learn unity.

This was a personal project, I made it during the summer holidays to discover unity and learn more about C#. The project was to implement a kind of basic AI to run an ecosystem.

I was really bad at making something esthetic in my code so I apologize if my code can not even be reused by some of you.
